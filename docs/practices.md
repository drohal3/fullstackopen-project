# File structure
Files in this project are grouped by features or routes as described in ReactJS [docs](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/faq-structure.html).

Questions:

Practices regarding redux - should I use useDistapch and useSelector directly in view/page files or create helper for those?
How about project structure? Where those "helpers" should be placed?

How about administration? Separate app or the same instance/any frameworks?

Where to set token in frontend (i.e. for article service)? Is App.js good place?
